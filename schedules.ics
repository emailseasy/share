SUMMARY:On-Ice: 3F & 3Lz under-rotation breakdown
DESCRIPTION:Monday\, November 10\, 2025\nDuration: 180 minutes\nIntensity: High\n\nFocus:\n- 3F & 3Lz under-rotation breakdown\n\nSchedule:\nBackwards stroking (15 min)\, 3F entry pattern drills (20 min)\, 15x 3Lz attempts with video review\, 20x 3F+3T attempts focusing on snap\, 3x SP run-throughs (focus on jump rotation\, not performance)\, LP first half run-through.\n\nNotes:\n1.  **Speed as the Engine:**\n    *   **Primary Action:** Execute your "Progressive Power Pulls" drill with an artistic focus. Feel the rhythm of the push and glide. The goal isn't just speed\; it's quiet speed\, driven from deep knee bend and core power.\n    *   **Off-Ice Link:** Your Single-Leg Box Jumps directly build the explosive power for this. Connect the feeling of loading and exploding in the gym to your on-ice stroking.\n    *   **What Judges See:** Unmistakable ice command and deep\, pure edges from the start. This sets the tone for the entire program.\n2.  **Transform Technical Elements into Artistry:**\n    *   **Goal:** Transform technical elements into moments of high artistry through superior control.\n    *   **Primary Action 1 (Spirals):** Integrate the "Banded Standing Arabesques" feeling into your on-ice High-Extension Spiral. Use the "Brace" cue to stabilize the core\, creating a dramatic\, unwavering line that commands attention.\n    *   **Primary Action 2 (Landings):** Treat every jump landing as a PCS drill. The "Brace and Square" cue is our tool to eliminate scrappy landings. A clean\, silent landing with immediate flow is a massive PCS win. This week\, we hold the landing edge for a full two counts on all solo jumps in practice.\n    *   **What Judges See:** Confidence\, control\, and extension. They see a skater who isn't just surviving elements but is performing through them.\n3.  **Maintain PCS Quality to the End:**\n    *   **Goal:** Maintain PCS quality through the end of the program\, proving stamina and thoughtful construction.\n    *   **Primary Action:** During your "back-half" run-throughs\, the focus is zero hesitation between elements. The transitions must look as rehearsed and intentional as the jumps. Use your "Attention Control Training" (breathing anchor) before these runs to lock in your focus on flow\, not just survival.\n    *   **Off-Ice Link:** This is where your conditioning work pays off. The goal is to finish the program with the same edge depth and upper-body carriage you started with.\n    *   **What Judges See:** A complete\, well-thought-out program skated with intent from start to finish. They reward skaters who look as strong at the end as they do at the beginning.

The goal isn't just speed\; it's quiet speed\, driven from deep knee bend and core power.\n    *   **Off-Ice Link:** Your Single-Leg Box Jumps directly build the explosive power for this. Connect the feeling of loading and exploding in the gym to your on-ice stroking.\n    *   **What Judges See:** Unmistakable ice command and deep\, pure edges from the start. This sets the tone for the entire program.\n2.  **Transform Technical Elements into Artistry:**\n    *   **Goal:** Transform technical elements into moments of high artistry through superior control.\n    *   **Primary Action 1 (Spirals):** Integrate the "Banded Standing Arabesques" feeling into your on-ice High-Extension Spiral. Use the "Brace" cue to stabilize the core\, creating a dramatic\, unwavering line that commands attention.\n    *   **Primary Action 2 (Landings):** Treat every jump landing as a PCS drill. The "Brace and Square" cue is our tool to eliminate scrappy landings. A clean\, silent landing with immediate flow is a massive PCS win. This week\, we hold the landing edge for a full two counts on all solo jumps in practice.\n    *   **What Judges See:** Confidence\, control\, and extension. They see a skater who isn't just surviving elements but is performing through them.\n3.  **Maintain PCS Quality to the End:**\n    *   **Goal:** Maintain PCS quality through the end of the program\, proving stamina and thoughtful construction.\n    *   **Primary Action:** During your "back-half" run-throughs\, the focus is zero hesitation between elements. The transitions must look as rehearsed and intentional as the jumps. Use your "Attention Control Training" (breathing anchor) before these runs to lock in your focus on flow\, not just survival.\n    *   **Off-Ice Link:** This is where your conditioning work pays off. The goal is to finish the program with the same edge depth and upper-body carriage you started with.\n    *   **What Judges See:** A complete\, well-thought-out program skated with intent from start to finish. They reward skaters who look as strong at the end as they do at the beginning.
