SUMMARY:On-Ice Training - Foundational Control & Right-Side Awareness
DESCRIPTION:Focus: Foundational Control & Right-Side Awareness\n\nDrills:\n- Warm-up on deep C-curves (15 min).\n- Isolated 3-turns for Flip (10 min).\n- Single Lutz and Salchow jumps focusing *only* on keeping the right side (shoulder, waist, hip) firm and lifted on takeoff.\n- Video review after every 5 attempts.\n\nNotes:\n- We are not focused on rotation today. The goal is to feel the stability of the right side as the primary engine.\n- Today's theme is Discipline. Commit to every entry pattern without restarting. Trust the process.
